# Kinic
## Search re-imagined for web3.

Web3 is all about ownership. We believe that content creators should be rewarded for their contributions to web3.

- Big tech eats most of web2 Ad revenue, even though it is not their content!
- We use 'smart-code' to map all of the frontend canisters on the Internet Computer.
- This allows us to do ✨Magic ✨ with that data.

## Features

- Search engine for text and canister IDs. (Frontend canisters only *for now.)
- Advertiser space for each category. Bid on with ICP.
- Profit sharing with content site owners. The more traffic you bring-in the larger your slice of the pie.

## Tech

Kinic uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- Motoko - IC backend programming language.
- Vue.js - Javascript framework.
- Tailwind.css - Beautiful designs fast.
- DFX - developer tool for the IC.


## Installation

Kinic requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16.7+ to run.

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
npm i // install dependencies
dfx deploy // deploy to your local dfx
vite serve // serves locally
```
## License

To Be Determined.. please change branding if you spin up a canister and plan on marketing it :)
